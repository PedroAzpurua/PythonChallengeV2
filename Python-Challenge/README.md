# Welcome to Python-Challenge

Hi Team, 

Please fidnd my submissing 3 file for the python Challenge. 

This submission includes two main folders. 
1. PyBank where we had to calculate monthly profit changes for the bank and display key calculations. trickiest aprt was ignoring the first month as it is not possible for there to be a profit change at time 1. 
2. PyPoll where we performed a count on the votes ballots and determined the resuts of the election. THis activity prints out a clear winner winning by over 70% of the votes. For this activity pelase reer to the V2 Python code in the "MainV2.py" file 

- This submissing includes the python code which looks into the data in the csv in the resources tab and prints out a text file in the analysis folder fro each of the activities above.
